## Part I: The Current Prosecutors



### **Miles Edgeworth: The Prodigy of Logic**



**Born:** 1992

**Height:** 6'0" (182cm)

**Defining Feature:** Magnificently fluffy cravat, unwavering gaze of logical superiority.



The name Edgeworth carries a weight that few can comprehend. Miles was born not merely into a family, but into a legacy. His father, the brilliant defense attorney Gregory Edgeworth, was a man who believed the truth could always be found through diligence and honesty. It was a philosophy that would cost him his life. The infamous DL-6 Incident—a harrowing ordeal in a stuck elevator that ended in his father's death and a young Miles's traumatized accusation of an innocent—was the crucible that forged the man he would become. The chaos, the emotion, and the perceived failure of his father's gentle approach to law left a permanent scar on his soul. He vowed that his world would never again be governed by the unpredictable whims of human feeling. It would be governed by one thing and one thing only: cold, hard logic.



This vow led him to the doorstep of the most fearsome prosecutor in history: Manfred von Karma. For years, Edgeworth trained under this dark mentor, who saw the boy's trauma not as a wound to be healed, but as a weapon to be sharpened. Von Karma taught him that a prosecutor's duty was not to find the truth, but to secure a guilty verdict by any means necessary. Forgery, manipulation, intimidation—all were simply tools to achieve the perfect, unblemished record that von Karma demanded. Edgeworth's brilliant mind absorbed these lessons, and he rose through the ranks at a terrifying speed, earning the moniker "the Demon Prosecutor." For over a decade, he was undefeated, a machine of flawless logic and ruthless tactics.



His signature crimson suit is his battle armor, and the ostentatious cravat is the banner of his self-imposed aristocratic detachment. It is a constant, tactile reminder that he is above the messy fray of common emotion. Yet, beneath the layers of silk and logic, a war raged within him. He was haunted by his father's memory and a deep, buried suspicion that the "truth" he so masterfully constructed in court was often just a beautiful, intricate lie.



His participation in the seemingly trivial debates of "Objection, Your Honor!" is, for him, a form of purification. In these low-stakes arenas, he can practice his craft in its purest form. When he argues whether a hot dog is a sandwich, he is not merely debating semantics; he is exercising the very muscle of logic itself, proving that its principles can and must apply to everything, from murder cases to lunchtime arguments. It is a way of reconnecting with the intellectual rigor of the law without the moral compromise that plagued his early career. To Edgeworth, an illogical argument about pizza toppings is a crack in the foundation of reason itself, and it must be exposed and destroyed with the same surgical precision he would apply to any other crime.

### **Winston Payne: The Rookie Crusher**



**Born:** 1968

**Height:** 5'7" (170cm)

**Defining Feature:** A suspiciously immobile combover, a perpetual sneer.



There was a time when Winston Payne was not the sniveling, condescending creature he is today. In his youth, he was the golden boy of his law school, a bright-eyed optimist with a crisp suit and a genuine belief in the prosecutorial system. He was tipped for greatness, the one most likely to succeed. And then came the case of the "Confounded Confectioner."



It was his first major trial, a high-profile corporate espionage case involving a stolen recipe for a revolutionary new type of gummy bear. Payne was confident, perhaps arrogantly so. He faced a little-known but fiercely charismatic defense attorney named Celeste Nightingale. The trial was going perfectly. Payne had the evidence, he had the witnesses, and he had the jury in the palm of his hand. He went in for the final cross-examination, a smug smile already on his face. With a flourish, he presented his "unbeatable" piece of logic.



Celeste Nightingale simply let him finish. Then she stood up, adjusted her glasses, and said, "Objection. The prosecutor's entire argument is a textbook example of a 'False Dilemma' fallacy." She then proceeded, in under ninety seconds, to not only dismantle Payne's logic but to use his own evidence to prove that the "stolen" recipe was, in fact, an expired patent that was now public domain. The courtroom, which had been on his side moments before, erupted in laughter. The Judge sustained the objection. The case was dismissed. The headline in the paper the next day read, "Wincing Payne Gets His Just Desserts."



That day, something inside Winston Payne broke. His confidence shattered into a million pieces. The humiliation was absolute. He could no longer face the brightest and best; the fear of being exposed as a fraud was too great. He retreated, developing a bitter, sneering persona as a defense mechanism. He requested transfers to quieter districts, taking on only the simplest of cases. And he discovered his new calling: crushing rookies.



Facing a trembling, inexperienced defense attorney is the only time Payne feels powerful again. It allows him to be the Celeste Nightingale in the room, the one with all the knowledge and power. His condescension is a shield, and his simple, often flawed, arguments are designed to intimidate those who don't yet have the confidence to challenge them. The toupee he wears isn't just for vanity; it's a desperate attempt to cover up the graying, thinning hair of a man whose career peaked and crashed on the very same day. Every time he wins against a rookie, it's a hollow echo of the victory he was so brutally denied.
